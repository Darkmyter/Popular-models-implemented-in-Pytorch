# <center>Pytroch implementation of popular models</center>

Implementation and light training examples[^1] for popular Deep Learning models in Pytorch from scratch.  

[^1]: PS: The goal of this project is to present simple examples written from scratch. It doesn't dive deep into optimizing the performance or analyzing the training (At least for now).
